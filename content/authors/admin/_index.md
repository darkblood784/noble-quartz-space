## About Me

I build end-to-end AI systems: LLM + RAG pipelines, APIs, and production deployments with Docker/K8s. Recently Iâ€™ve shipped a smart-contract staking platform (X Layer/BSC, 234K+ USDT staked), an LLM chatbot for crypto insights, and ML-driven trading bots. Previously at CCU, I worked on federated learning and trustworthy AI and co-authored papers in AI Review, Future Internet, ACM GoodIT, and IEEE ISC2.
